    "section": "",
    "text": "When the NBA instituted the three-point line for the 1979–80 season, no one envisioned it as the signature of the modern game. Borrowed from the ABA and college basketball, the three-pointer was a gimmick rather than a game plan. Teams averaged just 2.8 three-point attempts per game that season. The idea of building an offense around it was unthinkable. Players and coaches were still devoted to the midrange game, and big men controlled the paint. The first three-pointer ever taken? It came on October 12, 1979, from Chris Ford of the Boston Celtics. Fittingly enough, that same night was the NBA debut of Larry Bird, a player who would go on to show how perimeter shooting could be coupled with superstardom.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\n\nseasons &lt;- read_csv(\"perseason.csv\")\n\n\n\nX2025 &lt;- seasons |&gt; filter(Season == \"2024-25\")\nX1980 &lt;- seasons |&gt; filter(Season == \"1979-80\")\n\n\n\n\nggplot()+\n   geom_line(data=seasons, aes(x=Season, y=X3PA, group = 1), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=6, y=8, label =\"Three point line introduced\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=17, y= 18, label = \"Three point line shortened\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=29, y= 20, label = \"Stephen Curry is drafted\"), color=\"black\")  +\n  geom_text(aes(x=43, y= 37, label = \"Modern NBA\"), color=\"black\") +\n   scale_x_discrete(breaks=c(\"1979-80\", \"1984-85\", \"1988-89\", \"1992-93\", \"1996-97\", \"2000-01\", \"2004-05\", \"2008-09\", \"2012-13\", \"2016-17\", \"2020-21\", \"2024-25\")) +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Three pointers attempted\", \n    title=\"History of the three pointer\", \n    subtitle=\"Some important moments during it's life in the NBA.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Louie Frommelt\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three-point shot lingered on the fringes for years. It wasn’t until the 1994–95 season that the NBA promoted it largely. To boost scoring, the league temporarily shortened the three-point line to a uniform 22 feet across the arc (compared to 23’9” at the top of the key). The result? A massive spike in attempts and makes, teams averaged over 15 attempts a game, those three seasons. Dennis Scott and Glen Rice became specialists. But not everyone was a fan. It was criticized for warping the spacing and giving an unfair advantage to mediocre shooters. So for 1997–98, the league pushed the arc back out to its original distance. The experiment failed, but it planted a seed.\n\n\nThat seed did not have an opportunity to bloom until Stephen Curry entered the league in 2009 fully. Drafted 7th overall by the Golden State Warriors, Curry came into the league as a premier shooter, but even his biggest fans could not envision what was coming. By the mid-2010s, Curry had transformed the three-point shot. He wasn’t just knocking down open catch-and-shoot looks — he was pulling up 30 feet off the dribble, moving through defenders, and letting it go before defenses could get back. In 2015–16, Curry set a then-record by making 402 three-pointers in a season, something previously unimaginable. That year, he was the league’s first unanimous MVP. His success required defenses to extend further and protect more space, opening the floor in ways never imagined.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\n\nseasons &lt;- read_csv(\"perseason.csv\")\n\n\n\nX2016 &lt;- seasons |&gt; filter(Season == \"2015-16\")\n\n\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(data=seasons, \n             aes(x=X3PA, y=PTS),\n             color=\"lightgrey\"\n             ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = X1980,\n    aes(x=X3PA, y= PTS),\n    color= \"darkgreen\", ) +\n   geom_point(\n      data=X2025,\n      aes(x=X3PA, y= PTS),\n      color= \"blue\" ) +\n  geom_point(\n      data=X2016,\n      aes(x=X3PA, y= PTS),\n      color= \"orange\") +\n    geom_text_repel(\n    data=X1980, \n    aes(x=X3PA, y=PTS, label=Season)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=X2025, \n    aes(x=X3PA, y=PTS, label=Season)\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=X2016, \n    aes(x=X3PA, y=PTS, label=Season)\n  ) +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Three pointers attempted\", \n    y=\"Points per game\", \n    title=\"Do more threes mean more points\", \n    subtitle=\"Teams still found a way to score without the three ball.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Louie Frommelt\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three-point dominance only grew from there. By the 2023-24 season, teams were averaging over 35 three-point attempts per game. That’s over 12 times the 1979 average. Role players are now expected to shoot threes. Centers — once post-up players exclusively — are now”stretch bigs” that can space the floor. Analytics accelerated the trend, proving three-point attempts (even at a lower percentage) hold more expected value than long twos.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\nseasons &lt;- read_csv(\"perseason.csv\")\n\n\n\nfirstlast &lt;- seasons |&gt; filter(Season == \"2024-25\" | Season == \"1979-80\" |Season == \"2020-21\")\n\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=firstlast, aes(x=reorder(Season, `X3P%`), weight=`X3P%`), fill=\"#17408B\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Three point percentage\", \n    title=\"Efficiency of the shot\", \n    subtitle=\"Intresting shooting seasons in the NBA.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Louie Frommelt\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven during strange times, the three-ball dominated. During the 2020 NBA Bubble, created during the COVID-19 pandemic, players competed in empty gyms at Disney World. Despite the lack of fans and the surreal setting, scoring and three-point shooting were at historic highs. Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell traded 50-point dueling performances, fueled in great part by shots from beyond. It was just another reminder: the game had changed — permanently.\nFrom its origins to its current supremacy, the three-pointer has transformed every facet of the NBA — from player development to defense, from analytics to All-Star Weekend. What started as a gimmick is now the league’s most powerful weapon. Whether it’s Curry dribbling from the logo or role players camping out at the corner, one thing is for sure: the three-point era won’t be ending anytime soon."

    "section": "",
    "text": "David Kahn’s stint as general manager of the Minnesota Timberwolves is remembered more for what didn’t get done and more for its infamous draft disasters that plagued the team for years. From 2009 to 2011, Khan made a succession of head-scratching choices that not only kept the team from advancing but also became synonymous with poor draft management in the NBA. Let’s take those pivotal drafts up close and see how they both shaped his legacy and the path of the Timberwolves.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nX09draft &lt;- read_csv(\"09draft.csv\")\n\nX09draftupdate &lt;- X09draft  |&gt; \n  filter(G &gt; 162, PPG &gt; 9.1)\n\n\n\n\n\ncurry &lt;- X09draftupdate |&gt; filter(Player == \"Stephen Curry\")\nmin &lt;- X09draftupdate |&gt; filter(Player == \"Jonny Flynn\" | Player == \"Ricky Rubio\")\nderozan &lt;- X09draftupdate |&gt; filter(Player == \"DeMar DeRozan\")\nholiday &lt;- X09draftupdate |&gt; filter(Player == \"Jrue Holiday\")\n\n\nggplot() +\n    geom_point(\n        data=X09draftupdate,\n        aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n        color= \"lightgrey\"\n      ) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=curry,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"orange\", ) +\n    geom_point(\n      data=min,\n      aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n      color= \"blue\" ) + \n        geom_point(\n    data=derozan,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"red\", ) +\n      geom_point(\n    data=holiday,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"darkgreen\", ) +\n     geom_text_repel(\n    data=curry, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=min, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=holiday, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=derozan, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) +\n\n  labs(\n    x=\"Career points per game\", \n    y=\"Career games played\", \n    title=\"David Kahn and the worst draft blunder ever.\", \n    subtitle=\"The Timberwolves 2009 NBA draft picks, with some notable players that went after.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Louie Frommelt\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2009 NBA Draft is the most notorious of David Kahn’s choices. Having two top-10 selections (No. 5 and No. 6 overall), the Timberwolves had a golden opportunity to reshape their destiny. Instead, Kahn selected two point guards in succession: Ricky Rubio at No. 5 and Jonny Flynn at No. 6.\nOn the surface, Rubio was an intriguing foreigner, with a reputation for flashy passing and advanced basketball IQ. But he was already signed up in Spain and didn’t immediately go to the NBA, suppressing his contribution. The real issue was the Flynn draft. While Flynn had been good at Syracuse, drafting him immediately after Rubio confused analysts and fans alike. Worse yet, Kahn sacrificed a future superstar in Stephen Curry, who was drafted No. 7 by the Golden State Warriors and revolutionized the game of basketball.\nThe mistake was exacerbated as Curry continued to become a two-time MVP and four-time NBA champion, and Flynn struggled with injuries and was out of the league for three years. The Timberwolves, in their urgency for a franchise-changing talent, had missed on a generational player who sat there for the taking.\nAfter the abysmal 2009 draft, Khan was given a second opportunity for redemption in 2010. With the No. 4 overall selection, the Timberwolves drafted Wesley Johnson, a physical wing out of Syracuse. On paper, Johnson had the size, athleticism, and shooting stroke that made him sound like a slam dunk. Safe, though, is not necessarily successful.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nX10draft &lt;- read_csv(\"10draft.csv\")\n\n\n\n\njohnson &lt;- X10draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"Wesley Johnson\")\ncousins &lt;- X10draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"DeMarcus Cousins\")\nhayward &lt;- X10draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"Gordon Hayward\")\ngeorge &lt;- X10draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"Paul George\")\n\n\n\n\nggplot() +\n    geom_point(\n        data=X10draft,\n        aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n        color= \"lightgrey\"\n      ) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=johnson,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"blue\", ) +\n    geom_point(\n      data=cousins,\n      aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n      color= \"purple\" ) + \n        geom_point(\n    data=hayward,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"#00788C\", ) +\n      geom_point(\n    data=george,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"#FDBB30\", ) +\n     geom_text_repel(\n    data=johnson, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=cousins, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=hayward, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=george, \n    aes(x=PPG,y=G, label=Player)\n  ) +\n\n  labs(\n    x=\"Career points per game\", \n    y=\"Career games played\", \n    title=\"Back to back blunders for Kahn.\", \n    subtitle=\"The Timberwolves selected Wesley Johnson at four in 2010.

He lacked the shot-making ability and defensive consistency to be a solid starter. Maybe the most infuriating to Wolves fans was that future superstars DeMarcus Cousins, Gordon Hayward, and Paul George were left on the board. While Cousins had some off-court problems at the moment, his skill as an elite big was clear. Hayward and George emerged as All-Stars and leaders of their teams.\n\nJohnson’s unimpressive performance and subsequent exit from Minnesota heaped more depth onto Kahn’s already long history of blunders in drafts.\n\nThe 2011 draft was less painful but no less indicative of Kahn’s spotty decision-making. With the No. 2 overall pick, the Timberwolves took Derrick Williams, a do-everything forward from Arizona. Williams had impressed with his athleticism and scoring upside in college, especially his field efficiency.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nX11draft &lt;- read_csv(\"11draft.csv\")\n\nX11draftupdate &lt;- X11draft  |&gt; \n  filter(G &gt; 400, PPG &gt; 8.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwilliams &lt;- X11draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"Derrick Williams\")\nwalker &lt;- X11draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"Kemba Walker\")\nklay &lt;- X11draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"Klay Thompson\")\nkawhi &lt;- X11draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"Kawhi Leonard\")\n\n\n\nggplot() +\n   geom_smooth(data=X11draftupdate, aes(x=PPG, y=G), method = \"lm\") +\n    geom_point(\n        data=X11draftupdate,\n        aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n        color= \"lightgrey\"\n      ) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=williams,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"blue\", ) +\n    geom_point(\n      data=klay,\n      aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n      color= \"yellow\" ) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=walker,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"#00788C\", ) +\n      geom_point(\n    data=kawhi,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"red\", ) +\n     geom_text_repel(\n    data=williams, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=klay, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=walker, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=kawhi, \n    aes(x=PPG,y=G, label=Player)) +\n\n\n  labs(\n    x=\"Career points per game\", \n    y=\"Career games played\", \n    title=\"Kahn fails a third time.\", \n    subtitle=\"The Timberwolves selected Derrick Williams second overall in 2011.

He was not big enough to dominate as a postman and not talented enough to play successfully on the perimeter. His Minnesota career was marked by inconsistency and unfulfilled promises. Meanwhile, players like Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, and Kemba Walker, all selected outside the top 5, went on to have All-Star and even Hall of Fame-level careers.\nWhile Williams wasn’t nearly as big of a bust as Flynn, he wasn’t the cornerstone-type player that Minnesota desperately needed.\n\nDavid Kahn’s three-year draft legacy long outlasted the Timberwolves. His selections halted the rebuilding of the franchise and wasted precious high draft capital in draft classes full of future legends. Fans grew increasingly irate, and faith in the front office dropped to all-time lows. Kahn’s credibility was damaged, and he became an example of what happens when poor draft selections derailed a franchise for decades.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nX2009 &lt;- X09draftupdate |&gt; filter(Player == \"Stephen Curry\" | Player == \"Jonny Flynn\" | Player == \"Ricky Rubio\" | Player == \"DeMar DeRozan\" | Player == \"Jrue Holiday\")\nX2010 &lt;- X10draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"Wesley Johnson\" | Player == \"DeMarcus Cousins\" | Player == \"Gordon Hayward\" | Player == \"Paul George\")\nX2011 &lt;- X11draftupdate |&gt; filter(Player == \"Derrick Williams\" | Player == \"Kemba Walker\" | Player == \"Klay Thompson\" | Player == \"Kawhi Leonard\")\n\n\n\nkahn &lt;- bind_rows(X2009, X2010, X2011)\n\n\n\nminnesota &lt;- kahn |&gt; filter(Player == \"Jonny Flynn\" | Player == \"Ricky Rubio\" | Player == \"Wesley Johnson\" | Player == \"Derrick Williams\")\nkahnnomin &lt;- kahn |&gt; filter(Player == \"DeMarcus Cousins\" | Player == \"Gordon Hayward\"| Player == \"Paul George\" | Player == \"Stephen Curry\" | Player == \"DeMar DeRozan\" | Player == \"Jrue Holiday\" | Player == \"Kemba Walker\"| Player == \"Klay Thompson\" | Player == \"Kawhi Leonard\")\n\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=kahn, aes(x=G, y=PPG), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_line(data=minnesota, aes(x=G, y=PPG), color=\"blue\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits =  c(0, 25)) +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Career points per game\", \n    y=\"Career games played\", \n    title=\"Looking at them all together.\", \n    subtitle=\"A clear failure in drafting.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Louie Frommelt\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLater, Kahn was succeeded by Flip Saunders in 2013, and only then did the Timberwolves begin to get back on track. But the scars of those lost opportunities remained long after Kahn’s exit. In a league where drafting well is the secret to sustained success, David Kahn’s failures are a bitter reminder: talent evaluation and timing are everything."
