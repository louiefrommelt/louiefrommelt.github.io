    "text": "David Kahn’s stint as general manager of the Minnesota Timberwolves is remembered more for what didn’t get done and more for its infamous draft disasters that plagued the team for years. From 2009 to 2011, Khan made a succession of head-scratching choices that not only kept the team from advancing but also became synonymous with poor draft management in the NBA. Let’s take those pivotal drafts up close and see how they both shaped his legacy and the path of the Timberwolves.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nX09draft &lt;- read_csv(\"09draft.csv\")\n\nX09draftupdate &lt;- X09draft  |&gt; \n  filter(G &gt; 162, PPG &gt; 9.1)\n\n\n\n\n\ncurry &lt;- X09draftupdate |&gt; filter(Player == \"Stephen Curry\")\nmin &lt;- X09draftupdate |&gt; filter(Player == \"Jonny Flynn\" | Player == \"Ricky Rubio\")\nderozan &lt;- X09draftupdate |&gt; filter(Player == \"DeMar DeRozan\")\nholiday &lt;- X09draftupdate |&gt; filter(Player == \"Jrue Holiday\")\n\n\nggplot() +\n    geom_point(\n        data=X09draftupdate,\n        aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n        color= \"lightgrey\"\n      ) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=curry,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"orange\", ) +\n    geom_point(\n      data=min,\n      aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n      color= \"blue\" ) + \n        geom_point(\n    data=derozan,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"red\", ) +\n      geom_point(\n    data=holiday,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"darkgreen\", ) +\n     geom_text_repel(\n    data=curry, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=min, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=holiday, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=derozan, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) +\n\n  labs(\n    x=\"Career points per game\", \n    y=\"Career games played\", \n    title=\"David Kahn and the worst draft blunder ever.\", \n    subtitle=\"The Timberwolves 2009 NBA draft picks, with some notable players that went after.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Louie Frommelt\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2009 NBA Draft is the most notorious of David Kahn’s choices. Having two top-10 selections (No. 5 and No. 6 overall), the Timberwolves had a golden opportunity to reshape their destiny. Instead, Kahn selected two point guards in succession: Ricky Rubio at No. 5 and Jonny Flynn at No. 6.\nOn the surface, Rubio was an intriguing foreigner, with a reputation for flashy passing and advanced basketball IQ. But he was already signed up in Spain and didn’t immediately go to the NBA, suppressing his contribution. The real issue was the Flynn draft. While Flynn had been good at Syracuse, drafting him immediately after Rubio confused analysts and fans alike. Worse yet, Kahn sacrificed a future superstar in Stephen Curry, who was drafted No. 7 by the Golden State Warriors and revolutionized the game of basketball.\nThe mistake was exacerbated as Curry continued to become a two-time MVP and four-time NBA champion, and Flynn struggled with injuries and was out of the league for three years. The Timberwolves, in their urgency for a franchise-changing talent, had missed on a generational player who sat there for the taking.\nAfter the abysmal 2009 draft, Khan was given a second opportunity for redemption in 2010. With the No. 4 overall selection, the Timberwolves drafted Wesley Johnson, a physical wing out of Syracuse. On paper, Johnson had the size, athleticism, and shooting stroke that made him sound like a slam dunk. Safe, though, is not necessarily successful.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nX10draft &lt;- read_csv(\"10draft.csv\")\n\n\n\n\njohnson &lt;- X10draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"Wesley Johnson\")\ncousins &lt;- X10draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"DeMarcus Cousins\")\nhayward &lt;- X10draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"Gordon Hayward\")\ngeorge &lt;- X10draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"Paul George\")\n\n\n\n\nggplot() +\n    geom_point(\n        data=X10draft,\n        aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n        color= \"lightgrey\"\n      ) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=johnson,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"blue\", ) +\n    geom_point(\n      data=cousins,\n      aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n      color= \"purple\" ) + \n        geom_point(\n    data=hayward,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"#00788C\", ) +\n      geom_point(\n    data=george,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"#FDBB30\", ) +\n     geom_text_repel(\n    data=johnson, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=cousins, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=hayward, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=george, \n    aes(x=PPG,y=G, label=Player)\n  ) +\n\n  labs(\n    x=\"Career points per game\", \n    y=\"Career games played\", \n    title=\"Back to back blunders for Kahn.\", \n    subtitle=\"The Timberwolves selected Wesley Johnson at four in 2010.

He lacked the shot-making ability and defensive consistency to be a solid starter. Maybe the most infuriating to Wolves fans was that future superstars DeMarcus Cousins, Gordon Hayward, and Paul George were left on the board. While Cousins had some off-court problems at the moment, his skill as an elite big was clear. Hayward and George emerged as All-Stars and leaders of their teams.\n\nJohnson’s unimpressive performance and subsequent exit from Minnesota heaped more depth onto Kahn’s already long history of blunders in drafts.\n\nThe 2011 draft was less painful but no less indicative of Kahn’s spotty decision-making. With the No. 2 overall pick, the Timberwolves took Derrick Williams, a do-everything forward from Arizona. Williams had impressed with his athleticism and scoring upside in college, especially his field efficiency.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nX11draft &lt;- read_csv(\"11draft.csv\")\n\nX11draftupdate &lt;- X11draft  |&gt; \n  filter(G &gt; 400, PPG &gt; 8.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwilliams &lt;- X11draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"Derrick Williams\")\nwalker &lt;- X11draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"Kemba Walker\")\nklay &lt;- X11draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"Klay Thompson\")\nkawhi &lt;- X11draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"Kawhi Leonard\")\n\n\n\nggplot() +\n   geom_smooth(data=X11draftupdate, aes(x=PPG, y=G), method = \"lm\") +\n    geom_point(\n        data=X11draftupdate,\n        aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n        color= \"lightgrey\"\n      ) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=williams,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"blue\", ) +\n    geom_point(\n      data=klay,\n      aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n      color= \"yellow\" ) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=walker,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"#00788C\", ) +\n      geom_point(\n    data=kawhi,\n    aes(x=PPG, y= G),\n    color= \"red\", ) +\n     geom_text_repel(\n    data=williams, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=klay, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=walker, \n    aes(x=PPG, y=G, label=Player)\n  ) + geom_text_repel(\n    data=kawhi, \n    aes(x=PPG,y=G, label=Player)) +\n\n\n  labs(\n    x=\"Career points per game\", \n    y=\"Career games played\", \n    title=\"Kahn fails a third time.\", \n    subtitle=\"The Timberwolves selected Derrick Williams second overall in 2011.

He was not big enough to dominate as a postman and not talented enough to play successfully on the perimeter. His Minnesota career was marked by inconsistency and unfulfilled promises. Meanwhile, players like Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, and Kemba Walker, all selected outside the top 5, went on to have All-Star and even Hall of Fame-level careers.\nWhile Williams wasn’t nearly as big of a bust as Flynn, he wasn’t the cornerstone-type player that Minnesota desperately needed.\n\nDavid Kahn’s three-year draft legacy long outlasted the Timberwolves. His selections halted the rebuilding of the franchise and wasted precious high draft capital in draft classes full of future legends. Fans grew increasingly irate, and faith in the front office dropped to all-time lows. Kahn’s credibility was damaged, and he became an example of what happens when poor draft selections derailed a franchise for decades.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nX2009 &lt;- X09draftupdate |&gt; filter(Player == \"Stephen Curry\" | Player == \"Jonny Flynn\" | Player == \"Ricky Rubio\" | Player == \"DeMar DeRozan\" | Player == \"Jrue Holiday\")\nX2010 &lt;- X10draft |&gt; filter(Player == \"Wesley Johnson\" | Player == \"DeMarcus Cousins\" | Player == \"Gordon Hayward\" | Player == \"Paul George\")\nX2011 &lt;- X11draftupdate |&gt; filter(Player == \"Derrick Williams\" | Player == \"Kemba Walker\" | Player == \"Klay Thompson\" | Player == \"Kawhi Leonard\")\n\n\n\nkahn &lt;- bind_rows(X2009, X2010, X2011)\n\n\n\nminnesota &lt;- kahn |&gt; filter(Player == \"Jonny Flynn\" | Player == \"Ricky Rubio\" | Player == \"Wesley Johnson\" | Player == \"Derrick Williams\")\nkahnnomin &lt;- kahn |&gt; filter(Player == \"DeMarcus Cousins\" | Player == \"Gordon Hayward\"| Player == \"Paul George\" | Player == \"Stephen Curry\" | Player == \"DeMar DeRozan\" | Player == \"Jrue Holiday\" | Player == \"Kemba Walker\"| Player == \"Klay Thompson\" | Player == \"Kawhi Leonard\")\n\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=kahn, aes(x=G, y=PPG), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_line(data=minnesota, aes(x=G, y=PPG), color=\"blue\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits =  c(0, 25)) +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Career points per game\", \n    y=\"Career games played\", \n    title=\"Looking at them all together.\", \n    subtitle=\"A clear failure in drafting.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Louie Frommelt\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLater, Kahn was succeeded by Flip Saunders in 2013, and only then did the Timberwolves begin to get back on track. But the scars of those lost opportunities remained long after Kahn’s exit. In a league where drafting well is the secret to sustained success, David Kahn’s failures are a bitter reminder: talent evaluation and timing are everything."
